My website starts with the /me page. There are the information about my person.
One of the other sites is the CV. This is used to show where I have worked before. With the # I can refer directly on the
same page to the correct part of my CV. I have done it the same way for my interests.
I don't think this IRIs will be used in 100 years. First of all, I think the web as we know it today will disappear in a couple
of years. So I hope my IRIs will last at least for 5 years.

ELI5:
Linked Data is a way of connecting data through the web. So every data has a unique name, called URI. With this URI the data can
be identified and reach with HTTP (a protocol). Each URI should contain information about its content and links to other URIs.
With the rules written down by Tim Berners-Lee, Linked Data creates a web full of information.
