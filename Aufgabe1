My website starts with the /me page. There are the information about my person.
One of the other sites is the CV. This is used to show where I have worked before. With the # I can refer directly on the
same page to the correct part of my CV. I have done it the same way for my interests.
I don't think this IRIs will be used in 100 years. First of all, I think the web as we know it today will disappear in a couple
of years. So I hope my IRIs will last at least for 5 years.
